Art2D
=====

An increasingly elaborate basic graphics engine. Comes with physics and some software 2D plane projection.

Dependencies
------------

This project requires SFML and [cppregistry](https://github.com/Lucretiel/cppregistry). It was last tested on SFML 2.1, but I beleive SFML has a semver-style compatibility model, so any 2.X release should be alright.
